# Intrusion-Detection-System

Module: MPU-6050
========= Description ========
Name: MPU-6050 module (three-axis gyroscope + triaxial accelerometer)
2.54mm pin spacing
MPU-6050 Accelerometer + Gyro
The MPU-6050 sensor contains a MEMS accelerometer and a MEMS gyro in a single chip. It is very accurate, since it contains 16-bits analog to digital conversion hardware for each channel. Therefore it captures the x,y and z channel at the same time. 

======== Specification =======
16 bit AD converter-chip, 16 bit data output
Use Chip: MPU-6050
Power supply: 3-5v (internal low dropout regulator)
Communication:IIC communication standard
Gyro Range: ± 250 500 1000 2000 °/s
Acceleration Range: ±2 ±4 ±6 ±8 ±16g
Using Immersion Gold PCB, welding machine to ensure quality
Size: 2 x 1.6 x 0.1 mm
